## Team Contract (taige2-rl17-tkimura4-xinyih8) 

### Communication  

#### Team Meetings

- Our team will meet once a week every Thursday and Sunday **8:30 am Central Time** using either **WeChat** or **Zoom**. The length of the meeting time is really flexible depending on the development log entry described later, but each meet should take about an hour. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with taige2. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly development log entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting.  

#### Assistance  

- Each team member can be contacted through **email** or **WeChat**. If there is any question, idea, opinion, or help request, members should send their message in the WeChat group chat, and we commit to responding to others within *a day*.

#### Respect  

- The note taker for the week is responsible for the weekly development log entry, which serves as a guide for the weekly meeting. **All members will respect the decision and the draft made by the note taker, and the note taker for the week should also respect other members' opinions before crafting the draft.** The note taker also ensures the participation of all group members, including expressing their ideas and opinions about design decisions or any other project related topic. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.  

### Collaboration  

#### Work Distribution

- Each week, the necessary delivarables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will **volunteer to work** on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be **randomly assigned** to work on the task as a paired-programming team. This randomly assignment has equal amount of workload. However, if there is any unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis. If the workloads of the week is extremely complicated, members should discuss during the weekly meetings to come up with solutions.  

#### Time Commitment

- To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is **finished by the end of the week** *(Sunday weekly meeting)*. 
However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – **politely** – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members.  

#### Conflict Resolution

- If there is a conflict within a team. All members should explain their reasonings behind their arguments, and there should be a **vote** to determine the optimal solution. If there is a tie (2 vs 2), the team should request assistance from the mentor, or note taker for the week could make the final call.
